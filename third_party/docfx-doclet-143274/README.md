While the doclet helps output docfx yml, there are some differences in the way Google needs this outputed to align with
the other languages and look appropriate on [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference).

The original github repository for the doclet can be found at [github.com/docascode/docfx-doclet](https://github.com/docascode/docfx-doclet).

This doclet is forked from release [143274](https://github.com/docascode/docfx-doclet/releases/tag/143274) from June
2020 as it is still compatible with DocFX V2. This doclet has since been refactored and various features and fixes have
been included.
